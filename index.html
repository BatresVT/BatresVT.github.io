                <h3>School Life</h3>
                <p>I’m a senior and second year at Center for Technology, Essex. I am currently
                    in the Computer Animation & Web Design program. Outside of my program, I've also been enrolled in
                    several
                    college courses, such as English Literature, Pre-Calculus and Drawing I & II. I’m the president and
                    returning 2-year
                    member of the CTE Student Council, and I helped organize and start the CTE Queer Alliance Club. I’m
                    also a returning 2-year member of the Multicultural/Multilingual Affinity Group at CTE. </p>
                <h3>Work & Extracurriculars</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m the president and returning 2-year
                    member of the CTE Student Council, and I helped organize and start the CTE Queer Alliance Club. I’m
                    also a returning 2-year member of the Multicultural/Multilingual Affinity Group at CTE.
                    Outside of Essex, I participate in the Theatre Department at my homeschool, Champlain Valley Union
                    Highschool. I am the head lighting designer
                    and head program designer for CVU Theater, and have been involved for the last 2 years. I also am
                    employed at Jersey Mike's in Williston, and enjoy making subs for customers and friends. I’ve been
                    in
                    the workforce my entire high school career, with over five jobs under my belt since 2020.</p>
                <h3>Personal Life & Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy spending quality time with friends and family. I enjoy traveling, often
                    visiting Philadelphia, Toronto, Montpelier, and other cities. I practice my Spanish with my father
                    and his extended family, who all hail from Guatemala, and continue to pursue more knowledge about my
                    culture and heritage. I play video games with my friends online, using a computer that I purchased
                    and built myself. I love playing with my dog Dr Kraumboucher, my cats Bean and Gumbo, and my bearded
                    dragon Tsunade. I also love going to the gym and lifting weights, something that I can do with my
                    entire gym-enthused family.
