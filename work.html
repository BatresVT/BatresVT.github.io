                    <figcaption> <p class="leftAdjust">A compilation of some of my digital artwork, this serves as a sort
                        of digital sketchbook in order to showcase my use of digital
                        mediums for art. Going top to bottom, left to right: Grumpty
                        Dumpty is a character created from a practice of value shading
                        using a grey-scaled egg as a reference point. The beetle is
                        created again as a practice of value shading, using a grey-scaled
                        beetle as a reference. The Beetles is a goofy art piece created to
                        parody the band, "The Beatles". I tried to keep the height and
                        instruments as accurate as possible to the members of the band.
                        The candy cane house was created from a prompt of "Candy
                        Cane" for a speed design challenge. Using a variety of pastel
                        colors on photoshop, I wanted to create something both holly and
                        jolly that still incorporates the theme of candy canes and the
                        holiday season. The last piece is just practicing human poses
                        digitally, both drawn from reference poses I took of myself.</p>

                        <p class="leftAdjust">
                        This is an original character I created named "Desi" as a project
                        for a summer camp I attended. Though never used in any later
                        project, she was created as a practice of character creation and
                        concept art. Her backstory is as follows.
                        Desi comes from a village of humans plagued with the genetic
                        alterations of chemical warfare resulting from the ongoing WW3.
                        The necessity for acute sensory capabilities in combination with
                        radiation, Desi and her tribe have evolved to possess ear
                        alteration.
                        A soft-spoken and quiet member of her village, Desi is a character
                        made to represent my gender expression of struggle, and desire
                        to present my identity in a non-traditional way, creating Desi was a
                        sort of outlet for me to do so.</p>

                        This is an animation created in Blender using a Coral Reef 3D
                        environment created by myself. All asssets are original and only
                        textures were sourced from the web. Using the creative process of
                        storyboarding, sound designing, and post-production editing, this
                        was a project to practice my skills as my own 1-person art studio
                        team. If I were to revisit this project, I would want to fine tune the scene of the water blast, as well as making sure the Angler fish doesn't clip through the plant or ground. Additionally, I would change and update some of the sound effects to assist with the immersion and under-water fantasy theme.
